## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Entirely Python-based, utilizes the Hugging Face transformers pipeline.
- Maintains a limited chat history to provide context (last 5 interactions).
- Interactive REPL-style loop (`while True`) for seamless chatting.
- Compact and efficient model (FLAN-T5-small) optimized for fast CPU/Colab execution.
